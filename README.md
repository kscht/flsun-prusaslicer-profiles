These settings correspond to what shipped with FLSun Slicer, now packaged in a way that's digestable by PrusaSlicer. They can be considered the "official FLSun" settings for these printers: I've not changed anything that relates to printer behavior except for one thing: made Gyroid the default infill instead of Grid. Speeds, extrusion parameters, etc. match the FLSun-published values.

Download from Releases then start the Configuration Wizard in Prusa Slicer, and point at the .zip file in the Local Configuration Sources section.
